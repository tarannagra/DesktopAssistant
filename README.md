# DesktopAssistant
This is my personal desktop assistant. I predict it will not be done for a while - perhaps a year or two.

## What would I like this to do?
- Be awesome
- Be fast
- Have the ability to search the vast interwebs.
- Have an optional voice input/output file.
- Have the ability to hide the console window and either a keypress or vocal command makes it re-appear again.

## Licence
Please refer to the [licence](LICENSE) file in the current directory. This will be present in all of the program files, you will be familiarised with it.
